== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't see the Featured Content menu in my customizer, where can I find it? =

To make the Featured Content menu appear in your customizer, you need to install the [Jetpack plugin](http://jetpack.me) because it has the required code needed to make [featured content](http://jetpack.me/support/featured-content/) work for the Canard theme.

Once Jetpack is active, the Featured Content menu will appear in your customizer. No special Jetpack module is needed and a WordPress.com connection is not required for the Featured Content feature to function. Featured Content will work on a localhost installation of WordPress if you add this line to `wp-config.php`:

`define( 'JETPACK_DEV_DEBUG', TRUE );`

= Where can I add widgets? =

Canard offers two widget areas, which can be configured in Appearance → Widgets:

* An optional sidebar widget area, which appears on the right.
* An optional footer widget area.

= How do I add the Social Links to the header? =

Canard allows you display links to your social media profiles, like Twitter and Facebook, with icons.

1. Create a new Custom Menu, and assign it to the Social Links Menu location.
2. Add links to each of your social services using the Links panel.
3. Icons for your social links will automatically appear if it's available.
