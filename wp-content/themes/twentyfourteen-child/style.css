/*
 * Theme Name:     Twenty Fourteen Child
 * Theme URI:      http://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/foxy/
 * Description:    Twenty Fourteen Child Theme
 * Template:       twentyfourteen
 * Version:        1.0.0
 * 
 * Had named the child theme FOLDER - 'twenty-fourteen-child' but it wasn't working (had it ever worked this way? I think so!)
 * Anyways - I renamed the child theme folder to 'twentyfourteen-child' and then it worked - but I couldn't save any additional
 * changes in the text editor so I had to close the window and reopen. Very weird.
